# Piano Exercise Matrix

## üéπ Project Description

The Piano Exercise Matrix is a web-based application designed to help piano students and enthusiasts organize and track their practice routines. It provides a dynamic matrix of piano exercises based on selected keys and scales, a visual piano to display scales, and a practice log to keep track of progress.

*(I will add more detail here about my vision for the Piano Exercise Matrix becoming a multi-instrument and songwriting tool later).*

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dynamic Exercise Matrix:** Generates a table of relevant piano exercises based on user-selected musical keys and scale types.
* **Scale Visualizer:**
    * Displays selected scales on a visual piano keyboard.
    * Supports a comprehensive list of root notes (including enharmonics) and scale types (major, minor, modes, etc.).
* **Interactive Controls:**
    * Dropdowns to select root notes and scale types for the visualizer.
    * "Show Scale" button to update the piano display.
    * "Update Matrix" button to populate the exercise table based on the visualizer's current key selection.
* **Detailed Exercise Table:**
    * Lists exercises with options for Tempo, Metronome Click Pattern, BPM, Rhythm Pattern, Subdivision, and practice Time (Hours/Minutes).
    * Hierarchical display of exercise names (Key / Base Exercise / Parenthetical details).
    * Customizable two-row table header with a "Metronome" super-header.
* **Practice Logging:**
    * Log exercises directly from the matrix row, capturing all selected parameters.
    * Manual practice log for free-form entries.
    * Persistent practice history stored in `localStorage`.
    * Ability to delete individual practice log entries.
    * Print functionality for the practice history.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean layout with distinct sections for visualization, matrix, and practice tracking.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3 (including Flexbox for layout)
* JavaScript (ES6+) - Vanilla JS, no external frameworks for core logic yet.

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1.  Clone this repository or download the files.
2.  Ensure you have `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` in the same project folder.
3.  Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

*(When I deploy it to GitHub Pages, I'll add the live URL here later).*

## üîÆ Future Plans (Examples)

*‚úîÔ∏è Integrate Tone.js for audio playback of scales and exercises.
* Integrate VexFlow for sheet music display of scales and exercises.
* Develop a more advanced calendaring system for practice tracking.
* Expand to include a "Vocal Exercise Matrix."
* Add a "Songwriting and Story" module with relevant datasets.
* Refine table column widths and overall UI based on further testing.

## üìù Notes

This project started as a CodePen experiment and is being developed further. It's a learning project focused on building a useful tool for musicians.
